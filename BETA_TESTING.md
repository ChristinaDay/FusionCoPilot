## üìã Beta Testing Overview

### **What is Fusion 360 Co-Pilot?**

Fusion 360 Co-Pilot is an AI-powered add-in that transforms natural language descriptions into precise CAD operations. Instead of manually creating sketches, extrudes, and features, you can simply describe what you want to create.

**Example Workflow:**
1. **Input**: "Create a 100x50x10mm mounting plate with 4 holes"
2. **Co-Pilot**: Generates structured plan with all operations
3. **Preview**: Review operations before execution
4. **Execute**: Watch as Fusion 360 creates the geometry

### **What We're Testing**

- **Natural Language Understanding**: How well the AI interprets your requests
- **Operation Accuracy**: Whether generated CAD operations are correct
- **User Experience**: Interface usability and workflow efficiency
- **Performance**: Response times and system stability
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual requests and error handling
